# Legislative Rules of Liberland

## Preface
This Law establishes the obligatory standards for the formulation of legislation in the Republic of Liberland. The Law provides explicit regulations pertaining to the interpretation, language use, terminology, and structural format that legislative drafters must comply with. 

In the interest of systematic consistency and clarity, this Act delineates a binding framework for the organization of laws into articles and paragraphs. This structure is intended to promote coherence, facilitate comprehension, and provide an easy reference for legislative authorities and the public alike.

Furthermore, the Law introduces an enumerated list of technical terms or "terms of art" pertaining to lawmaking in Liberland. This provision is designed to ensure a uniform understanding of legal language and concepts within the legislative environment, thereby advancing clear communication and reducing the potential for misinterpretation.

By standardizing the drafting process, the Act contributes to the overall transparency, predictability, and legitimacy of the legislative process in the Republic of Liberland. Consequently, it serves the larger objective of strengthening the rule of law and democratic governance in the Republic.

## Section 1: Linguistic Elements and Articulation Style

### Article 1: Official Language
All legislative texts pertaining to the jurisdiction of Liberland shall be scripted in the recognized dialect of Liberlandish, a variant of English prevalent and comprehensible within the confines of Liberland.

### Article 2: Articulation Style
Legislative authorities in Liberland shall maintain a formal and professional modus operandi of communication. Notwithstanding this formality, the language utilized shall retain clarity and comprehensibility for the general populace, rather than being restricted to professional comprehension.

### Article 3: Terminology Usage
#### § 1 Interpretation of Legal Terms
The terminology applied shall consistently be interpreted within the context of commonly accepted meanings. Technical terms borrowed from scientific or other academic disciplines shall be interpreted within their respective contexts. Such terms accepted from common parlance or from academia, etc. shall not be capitalized.

#### § 2 Legislative Definitions
1. In instances where it becomes imperative to deviate from the universally accepted interpretation of a term, the legislative authority shall employ a "Legislative Definition." This shall be initiated by the term "henceforth," or by an equivalent word that unequivocally introduces a new definition. Subsequently, the term being defined shall be capitalized in its entirety, e.g., "Legislative Definition."
2. All terms defined for the purpose of legislative comprehension within the Constitution and Laws of Liberland shall be cataloged in Appendix A of this Legislation.
3. Legislators drafting Regulations other than the Constitution or Laws, are not permitted to define terminologies by means of a Legislative Definition beyond what is already defined in the Constitution and the Laws.

### Article 4: Classification of Linguistic Styles
#### § 1. Primary Adoption of Prescriptive Linguistic Form
1. The predominant form of language employed shall be of prescriptive or normative nature, whereby legislative instructions are conveyed through explicit directives or prohibitions to an indeterminate body of recipients.
2. The aforementioned recipients may either remain unspecified, wherein all individuals under the jurisdiction of Liberland are implicitly encompassed, or be identified according to their distinct characteristics.

#### § 2. Supplementary Use of Explanatory Linguistic Form
In circumstances where the legislative author anticipates potential confusion or ambiguity amongst the informed, non-specialist demographic of Liberland, they are permitted to supplement the prescriptive text with elucidations, descriptions, and clarifications to foster comprehension.

#### § 3. Linguistic Form to Facilitate Judicial and Official Interpretation
In instances where the legislative author deems it judicious to accompany the prescriptive text with additional statements to aid legal interpretation, such provisions are permissible, provided these do not compromise the readability and the intrinsic normative character of the legal text.

## Section 2: Guidelines for Interpretation
### Article 5: General Rules of Interpretation
1. Legislation within Liberland shall be understood and interpreted according to its plain, literal, and ordinary meaning, as discernible to an informed, typical resident of Liberland reading with a commonly assumed level of dilligence.
2. Legislation within Liberland shall be drafted with the anticipation that its provisions will be interpreted in accordance with contemporary and established rules and techniques of statutory interpretation, routinely employed by expert legal professionals in jurisdictions considered peers to Liberland.

### Article 6: Specific Rules of Interpretation

#### § 1. Conflicts between legal norms
In instances of uncertainty pertaining to the precedence of one norm over another, the legislative drafter shall consider the following rules as valid:

a) A norm of superior hierarchical stature shall supersede a norm of inferior hierarchical stature; for example, an international custom prevails over an international treaty, an international treaty prevails over the Constitution within the framework designed to resolve this conflict, the Constitution prevails over the Law, and the Law prevails over any other Regulation.

b) A specific norm shall interpret and hold precedence over general norms.

c) A more recent norm shall interpret and hold precedence over earlier norms.

#### § 2. Employment of Originalist Interpretation
1) In instances where a literal interpretation fails to yield a clear legal understanding, the legislative drafter shall resort to the application of the Originalist Interpretation method. This method calls for the interpretation of the Law of Liberland in accordance with the original intent and significance underpinning the legislative creation at the time when the legal instrument assumed lawful validity.
2) Should such an interpretative approach yield conspicuously absurd outcomes or those manifestly detrimental to the liberty of the individual, the law shall instead be construed in accordance with the intention of the legislature, discerned by identifying the issue or issues it sought to resolve and establishing the optimal solutions thereto. This interpretation shall endeavor to maintain fidelity to the literal meaning and originalist interpretation as closely as feasible.

## Section 3: Dividing the law
### Article 7: Fundamental Textual Segments

#### § 1. Structure of Articles
1. The primary segment of text shall be constituted as an Article, embodying a solitary declaration or a cluster of associated declarations.
2. Articles shall be assigned a sequential numbering format ranging from 1 through N, where N denotes the concluding article in the designated legal instrument.
3. The onset of each Article shall be heralded by a subject label comprising the phrase "Article N:", where "N" signifies the number; subsequently, the title of the Article shall be inscribed, commencing with a capital letter.

#### § 2. Subdivisions within Articles
1. In circumstances where the declarations encompassed within a single Article are intrinsically linked, to the extent that their segregation would result in a significant alteration or loss of meaning, they shall be consolidated within a single paragraph.
2. Conversely, if the declarations maintain a degree of connectivity, yet not so profound as to necessitate their conflation, they shall be distributed across separate paragraphs.

## Preamble

## Definitions

## Section 1: Administrative process

### Article 1: Purpose of the Administrative Process

#### § 1: Definition and Scope
Administrative Process shall be the standardized procedural rules that govern the actions of the Executive bodies within Liberland. These rules are designed to ensure the systematic execution of responsibilities, thereby promoting public administration's effective and accountable functioning.

#### § 2: Governing Principles
The principles of fairness, transparency, and due process shall govern the Administrative Process. It shall be designed and executed to safeguard the rights of individuals and entities, reinforcing the integrity and accountability of public administration within Liberland.

### Article 2: Mandatory Steps in an Administrative Process

#### § 1: Progression of Actions
The General Administrative Process comprises a sequence of orderly actions, beginning with the submission of an application or request. This is followed by a review and evaluation by the competent authority, leading to the issuance of a decision.

#### § 2: Forms of the Administrative Process
1. The General Administrative Process shall serve as the standard form of the Administrative Process. 
2. In particular cases where the unique nature of a process before a specific administrative organ necessitates a different approach, such variations shall be outlined by this Law or by another dedicated law pertaining to that process. Where such a law does not provide guidance, the provisions of this Law and of the General Administrative Process outlined therein shall apply. 
2. Notwithstanding any special provisions, the principles governing the Administrative Process as defined in this Law shall remain in effect.

#### § 3: Appeal Mechanism
In all instances, the Administrative Process shall provide a mechanism for appeal, ensuring that decisions can be reviewed and, if necessary, revised.

### Article 3: Applicability of this Law

#### § 1: Universal Applicability
1. This Law shall preside over the actions of all bodies of the Executive without exception. Furthermore, it shall apply to the actions of all other public bodies within Liberland, provided its application is reasonably feasible.
2. Other entities, including private individuals and institutions, may voluntarily adopt the rules of the Administrative Process, thereby binding themselves to its provisions.
3. Any entity or body of any nature that applies the Administrative Process shall be referred to as an "Administrative Organ."

#### § 2: Unconditional Application of Principles
The principles delineated in this Law shall apply universally to all Administrative Organs and all public bodies, without exception.

### Article 4: Subsidiary Application of the Process Law
Where this or other Laws remain silent, the Process Law shall apply.

## Section 2: General Administrative Process
### Article 5: Initiation of the Administrative Process

#### § 1: Application-Driven Initiation
The Administrative Process shall commence upon the submission of an Application. The rules governing this Application shall be consistent with those applicable to an Application before a court.

#### § 2: Ex-Officio Initiation
In instances where a specific Law permits, the Administrative Organ may initiate the Administrative Process autonomously, exercising its own authority.

### Article 6: Participants in the Administrative Process

#### § 1: Mandatory Parties
1. The Administrative Process shall always involve the Administrative Organ's participation and at least one individual or institution. 

#### § 2: Additional Parties
In specific instances, as prescribed by this Law or other specific laws, additional subjects may become parties to the Administrative Process.

### Article 7: Designation of Responsible Officials
1. The Administrative Organ shall appoint one or, in situations of a special, dire need in order to safeguard the interests of the parties, more individuals as Responsible Officials. The Responsible Official or Officials shall undertake the process independently, executing their duties to the best of their abilities.
2. The Responsible Officials shall oversee the process in a manner akin to how a Judge presides over judicial proceedings.

### Article 8: Preference for Written Process
The Administrative Process shall predominantly be conducted in writing, employing as a rule asynchronous modes of communication.

### Article 9: Synchronous Proceedings
1. The Administrative Organ shall organize and hold synchronous proceedings when all parties, excluding the Administrative Organ, who are in a contradictory position towards each other, have collectively agreed to such a process.
2. Alternatively, synchronous proceedings shall be initiated upon the request of a weaker party to safeguard their interests. The Administrative Organ shall organize and hold synchronous proceedings when there is a clear and immediate need to uphold the fairness of the process. This provision shall apply even in instances where there is only one party in addition to the Administrative Organ, with the Administrative Organ being considered the stronger entity.

### Article 10: Conduct of Synchronous Proceedings
#### § 1: Administration of Proceedings
Synchronous proceedings shall be conducted before the Administrative Organ and shall be presided over by a Responsible Official. In instances where multiple Responsible Officials are appointed, all shall preside over the proceedings.

#### § 2: Rules Governing Proceedings
The conduct of Synchronous Proceedings shall adhere to the rules of the Trial as stipulated by the Process Law.

### Article 11: Procedural Standards for the Administrative Organ

### § 1: Adherence to Legal Principles and Factual Accuracy
The Administrative Organ is obligated to ensure that its conduct and resultant decisions are in strict compliance with the prevailing legal framework. Furthermore, the Administrative Organ shall only proceed with actions when it possesses a substantial degree of factual certainty. All actions must be predicated upon information that is both accurate and reliable.

### § 2: Duty of Investigation and Evidentiary Requirements
The Administrative Organ is mandated to conduct a comprehensive investigation pertaining to the case and must provide a clear and detailed reasoning for its actions. This reasoning must be based on the facts of the case and the applicable law. This includes the obligation to gather all necessary evidence and to resolve any existing ambiguities or uncertainties.

### § 3: Principle of Impartiality
The Administrative Organ is required to exercise absolute impartiality concerning the interests of all parties involved throughout the entire procedural process. Concurrently, it shall also function as a faithful representative of Liberland. In instances where these two obligations appear to conflict, the principle of impartiality shall take precedence.

### Article 12: Issuance of Administrative Decisions

#### § 1: Purpose and Composition of the Decision
1. A decision shall constitute a distinct act of the Administrative Organ, promulgated in writing, through which rights, legally protected interests, or obligations are established, modified, nullified, or ascertained, or through which a request or protest is dismissed or rejected.
2. A decision shall represent the culmination of the Administrative Process and shall incorporate, in written form, the rationale and reference to all evidence utilized not only in the formulation of the decision but also in all preceding actions.

#### § 2 Section 2: Form and Content of the Decision
1) A decision shall be rendered in writing and dispatched in an official copy to each party involved in the Administrative Process, with a duplicate retained by the Administrative Organ. The format of the decision shall be official, designed to facilitate readability and comprehension of the content by the concerned party or by the informed public in the case of the official copy pertaining to the Administrative Organ.
2) A decision shall encompass the following elements:

a) Identification of the Administrative Organ: The decision shall unambiguously identify the Administrative Organ issuing the decision.

b) Parties Involved: The decision shall delineate the parties implicated in the case.

c) Facts of the Case: The decision shall detail the facts of the case, inclusive of any pertinent evidence.

d) Legal Basis: The decision shall cite the legal foundation for the decision, inclusive of any applicable laws or regulations.

e) Reasoning: The decision shall provide a lucid and comprehensive rationale for the decision, elucidating how the facts of the case and the applicable law informed the decision.

f) Decision: The decision itself shall be clearly articulated.

g) Instructions for Appeal: If applicable, the decision shall provide instructions on the process for lodging an appeal, inclusive of any deadlines for filing an appeal.

h) Date and Signature: The decision shall be dated and signed by the appropriate official from the Administrative Organ.

#### § 3: Legal Effect
1) The decision shall acquire legal effect eight days subsequent to its issuance, thereby concluding the Administrative Process in the concerned matter.
2) In the event that the decision is appealed against, it shall not acquire legal effect.

## Section 3: Issuance of Payment Orders

### Article 13: Procedure for Issuing a Payment Order
1) In instances where an Administrative Process is initiated against one or more parties and it becomes evident to the Administrative Organ from the outset that they are likely obligated to remit payment to the Administrative Organ, such as in the case of a misdemeanor, the Administrative Organ shall issue a Payment Order.
2) The Payment Order shall incorporate the following information:

a) Identification of the Administrative Organ: The Payment Order shall unambiguously identify the Administrative Organ issuing the order.

b) Parties Involved: The Payment Order shall delineate the parties implicated in the case and the party to which the Payment Order is directed.

c) Simplified Facts of the Case: A concise summary of the facts of the case, presented in a manner that is easily comprehensible to the average person.

d) Duty to Pay: The Payment Order shall specify the obligation of the addressee to remit payment to the Administrative Organ within eight working days, including the exact amount to be paid.

e) Information Regarding the Issuance of an Objection: The Payment Order shall provide information on the process for lodging an Objection in accordance with this law.

### Article 14: Procedure for Lodging an Objection
The party to which the Payment Order is directed may lodge an Objection within eight working days of the issuance of the Payment Order. Upon receipt of the Objection, the Payment Order loses legal force and is considered as if it had never been issued. At this juncture, the Administrative Organ may choose to terminate the Administrative Process or may proceed as if the process had commenced at the time of receipt of the Objection.

### Article 15: Issuance of On-Site Payment Orders
1) An On-Site Payment Order, such as a traffic fine, shall be issued by the Administrative Organ when the conditions for the issuance of a standard payment order are satisfied, and the grounds for issuance have been directly observed by the Responsible Official or by an individual assisting them who is under their authority, and the facts of the case are sufficiently evidenced to the Responsible Official.
2) The party addressed may decline to accept the On-Site Payment Order, which shall be understood by the Administrative Organ as lodging an Objection to it.

### Article 16: Submission of a Reasoned Objection
1) In general, if the addressed party accepts the On-Site Payment Order, they shall be deemed to have waived their right to lodge objections. However, if the party can demonstrate that they were uninformed, incapable of providing informed consent, or subject to other extenuating circumstances, they may, within one month of their acceptance, submit a Reasoned Objection.
2) Unlike a standard Objection, a Reasoned Objection shall incorporate the reasons elucidating the circumstances and providing evidence in support of their assertions.
3) The Administrative Organ shall review the Reasoned Objection and, if it determines that the arguments possess merit, shall rescind the Payment Order, and it will be as if an Objection was lodged within the prescribed timeframe. When there is doubt, the Administrative Organ shall accept the Reasoned Objection.

## Section 4: Administrative Organ Actions
### Article 17: Intervention in Cases of Necessity
1. In instances where a Responsible Person of an Administrative Organ, tasked with the protection of a certain public good, discerns that a person, property, or other entity under their protection is being compromised—either damaged or exposed to clear and imminent danger—due to the action or omission of a person or institution, the Responsible Person is obligated to intervene to prevent further compromise of their charges.
2. When intervening in this manner, the Responsible Person shall adopt the least intrusive approach that is overwhelmingly likely to result in the cessation of the actions that pose a threat or cause damage to their charges.

# Delict Law

## Chapter 1: General provisions

### Title 1: Committing Delicts

#### Article 1: Definition of Delict

1. A delict is defined as either:

   a) An action that breaches the Non-Aggression Principle, leading to identifiable harm to another person, or, in exceptional cases,

   b) An action that significantly violates established laws, irrespective of whether the victim is easily identifiable.

2. Any individual, whether they are permanently or temporarily under the jurisdiction of Liberland, is responsible for the delicts they commit. If found guilty, they are obligated to make restitution to the victims and will be subject to penalties as outlined in this law to deter future delictual behavior.

#### Article 2: Perpetration of a Delict

1. An individual is considered a Perpetrator if, through their culpable conduct, they fulfill the elements of a Delict or its attempt.

2. A perpetrator also includes an individual who utilizes another individual, who is not liable for the Delict due to lack of age or incapacity, or because their conduct satisfies the conditions of self-defense, extreme necessity, or other circumstances negating unlawfulness.

3. A perpetrator also includes an individual who utilizes a legal entity that is not liable for the Delict.

4. Where the law so stipulates, a perpetrator also includes an individual who intentionally:

   a) Planned or directed the commission of the Delict (Organizer),

   b) Instigated another to decide to commit the Delict (Inciter), or

   c) Enabled or facilitated another in committing the Delict (Accomplice),

   provided that the Delict is completed or its attempt is punishable.

#### Article 3: Liability of the Perpetrator
1. Liability for a Delict requires culpability. 
2. Negligence suffices as culpability, unless the law explicitly states that intentional culpability is required.

#### Article 4: Intentional culpability
An offense is committed intentionally if the perpetrator:

   a) Intended to violate or endanger an interest protected by law, or

   b) Knew that their actions could violate or endanger an interest protected by law, and was willing to accept that risk.

#### Article 5: Negligence
An offense is committed negligently if the perpetrator:

   a) Knew that their actions could violate or endanger an interest protected by law, but without reasonable grounds relied on not violating or endangering that interest, or

   b) Did not know that their actions could violate or endanger an interest protected by law, but should and could have known given the circumstances and their personal situation.

### Title 2: Principles of Liability for Delicts

#### Article 6: Concurrent commission of multiple Delicts

##### Section 1: General Principle
In instances where multiple Delicts are committed through a single act, prosecution shall proceed solely for the Delict subject to the most severe penalty.

##### Section 2: Crimes and other Delicts
1. Where an act constitutes a Crime and also another Delict, in general, only the Crime shall be prosecuted according to the Criminal Law. 
2. In certain specific cases where this Law stipulates otherwise, committing crimes also results in the responsibility for other types of Delict.

#### Article 7: Attempted Delict
An attempted Delict shall be punishable in the same manner as a finished Delict, though the punishment might be less severe based on the circumstance.

#### Article 8: Continued Delict
A continuing Delict is understood to mean such conduct wherein individual constituent acts, guided by a unified intent, fulfil the elements of the same offence and are connected by the same or similar means of execution, close temporal proximity, and subject matter relatedness.

#### Article 9: Mass Offense
A mass offence is an offence for which the law requires multiple acts connected by a common intent for liability to arise for the offence.

#### Article 10: Omission
For the purposes of this law, "conduct" also includes the omission of such action to which the actor was obligated pursuant to another legal regulation or official decision, resulting from a voluntarily assumed duty to law or if his special obligation arose from his previous endangering conduct, or for which he was obligated for another reason based on the circumstances and his conditions.

#### Article 11: Co-offender
1. If a Delict or its attempt was committed by the intentional joint conduct of two or more individuals, each is liable as if they had committed the Delict alone.

2. If the Delict was committed by joint conduct of two or more entities, of which at least one is a legal person or a self-employed individual, each is liable as if they had committed the Delict alone.

#### Article 12: Special subject of a Delict
If the law requires a special characteristic, qualification, or status of the perpetrator for the commission of a Delict, the following may apply:

  a) The perpetrator can only be one who possesses the required characteristic, qualification, or status.

  b) A co-perpetrator can be one who possesses the required characteristic, qualification, or status, and also one who does not possess the required characteristic, qualification, or status, provided that at least one of the co-perpetrators possesses the required characteristic, qualification, or status.

### Title 3: Legal Entity accountability for Delicts

#### Article 13: Criteria for Legal Entity as Perpetrator

1. A Legal Entity is deemed the perpetrator when a delict is committed through the actions of an individual, whose conduct is attributable to the Legal Entity and who has breached a legal obligation incumbent upon the Legal Entity.

2. This applies when the individual is acting:

   a) In representation of the Legal Entity,
   
   b) In direct association with its operations, or
   
   c) For its benefit or advantage.

3. If an individual acting in such a capacity is culpable of a delict, the Legal Entity shall assume liability for the delict.

4. Full liability of the Legal Entity absolves the individual perpetrator, except when they are determined to be co-perpetrators or jointly accountable for the delict.

5. The Legal Entity's liability is not contingent upon identifying the specific individual responsible. The investigative body or court is also not obligated to identify this individual, particularly when it is evident that the actions were part of the Legal Entity's operations.

#### Article 14: Typical Agents for Legal Entity liability

For assessing a Legal Entity's liability, actions from the following individuals are considered attributable to the Legal Entity:

   a) Statutory bodies or their members,
   
   b) Other organizational bodies or their members,
   
   c) Employees or similar positions while performing job-related tasks,
   
   d) Individuals executing tasks for the Legal Entity,
   
   e) Individuals engaged by the Legal Entity in its operations,
   
   f) Individuals acting in the Legal Entity's interest, if the entity benefits from the outcome.

#### Article 15: Special Characteristics for Legal Entity Perpetrators

If the law stipulates special traits, capabilities, or statuses for a perpetrator who is a Legal Entity, such attributes need not be present in the individual whose actions are attributable to the Legal Entity.

#### Article 16: Special Conditions for Legal Entity liability

Liability of the Legal Entity remains intact even if:

   a) The individual's actions occurred prior to the Legal Entity's establishment,
   
   b) The Legal Entity was declared invalid by a court,
   
   c) The legal action intended to establish authority is invalid or ineffective,
   
   d) The Legal Entity utilized another entity or individual to commit a Delict, provided these entities are not liable for the Delict.

#### Article 17: Conditions for Legal Entity exemption

1. A Legal Entity is exempt from liability if it demonstrates that all reasonable preventive measures were taken.

2. Exemption is not applicable if the Legal Entity failed to exercise obligatory or necessary oversight over the individual responsible, or if it failed to implement necessary preventive measures.

### Title 4: Exemptions from Delict liability

#### Article 18: Justifiable emergency

1. An act that would otherwise be punishable as a Delict is exempt if committed to prevent an immediate and direct threat to a legally protected interest.

2. The exemption does not apply if the threat could have been mitigated by other means, if the harm caused by the act is equal to or greater than the impending danger, or if the person facing the danger was obligated to endure it.

#### Article 19: Legitimate self-defense

1. An act that would otherwise be punishable as a Delict is exempt if committed to ward off an immediate or ongoing attack on a legally protected interest.

2. The exemption does not apply if the defensive action is clearly disproportionate to the nature of the attack.

#### Article 20: Informed consent

1. An act that would otherwise be punishable as a Delict is exempt if committed with the informed consent of the individual whose legally protected interests are affected.

2. Consent must be given voluntarily, explicitly, and clearly, either prior to or during the act. Post-act consent is valid only if the actor could reasonably assume that consent would have been granted under the circumstances.

#### Article 21: Acceptable risk

1. An act that would otherwise be punishable as a Delict is exempt if it is conducted as part of a socially beneficial activity within the scope of one's employment, profession, or role, based on the information available at the time, even if it endangers or violates a legally protected interest, provided no alternative means to achieve the beneficial outcome are available.

2. The exemption does not apply if:

   a) The activity endangers human life or health without legal consent,
   
   b) The intended outcome clearly does not justify the level of risk involved, or
   
   c) The conduct clearly contradicts other legal regulations, public interest, ethical principles, or moral standards.

#### Article 22: Lawful use of weapons

An act is not considered a Delict if weapons are used within the boundaries established by Police Law.

#### Article 25: Definition and Scope of Misdemeanors
1. A Misdemeanor is defined as any delict specifically categorized as such under the provisions of this Law.

#### Article 26: Definition and Scope of Disciplinary Offenses
1. The State shall exercise disciplinary jurisdiction over all government agents or volunteers engaged in public projects who are either physically present within its territorial boundaries or are involved in tasks that are integral to and directly associated with the settlement.
